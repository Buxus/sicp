;;; idea is to simulate a baseball robot

;; imagine hitting a ball with an initial velocity of v 
;; at an angle alpha from the horizontal, at a height h
;; we would like to know how far the ball travels.

;; as a first step, we can just model this with simple physics
;; so the equations of motion for the ball have a vertical and a 
;; horizontal component

;; the vertical component is governed by
;; y(t) = v sin alpha t + h - 1/2 g t^2 
;; where g is the gravitational constant of 9.8 m/s^2

;; the horizontal component is governed by
;; x(t) = v cos alpha t
;; assuming it starts at the origin

;; First, we want to know when the ball hits the ground
;; this is governed by the quadratic equation, so we just need to know when 
;; y(t)=0 (i.e. for what t_impact is y(t_impact)= 0).
;; note that there are two solutions, only one makes sense physically

;; Problem 6

;; problem is that we are not accounting for drag on the ball (or on spin 
;; or other effects, but let's just stick with drag)
;;
;; Newton's equations basically say that ma = F, and here F is really two 
;; forces.  One is the effect of gravity, which is captured by mg.  The
;; second is due to drag, so we really have
;;
;; a = drag/m + gravity
;;
;; drag is captured by 1/2 C rho A vel^2, where
;; C is the drag coefficient (which is about 0.5 for baseball sized spheres)
;; rho is the density of air (which is about 1.25 kg/m^3 at sea level 
;; with moderate humidity, but is about 1.06 in Denver)
;; A is the surface area of the cross section of object, which is pi D^2/4 
;; where D is the diameter of the ball (which is about 0.074m for a baseball)
;; thus drag varies by the square of the velocity, with a scaling factor 
;; that can be computed

;; We would like to again compute distance , but taking into account 
;; drag.
;; Basically we can rework the equations to get four coupled linear 
;; differential equations
;; let u be the x component of velocity, and v be the y component of velocity
;; let x and y denote the two components of position (we are ignoring the 
;; third dimension and are assuming no spin so that a ball travels in a plane)
;; the equations are
;;
;; dx/dt = u
;; dy/dt = v
;; du/dt = -(drag_x/m + g_x)
;; dv/dt = -(drag_y/m + g_y)
;; we have g_x = - and g_y = - gravity
;; to get the components of the drag force, we need some trig.
;; let speeed = (u^2+v^2)^(1/2), then
;; drag_x = - drag * u /speed
;; drag_y = - drag * v /speed
;; where drag = beta speed^2
;; and beta = 1/2 C rho pi D^2/4
;; note that we are taking direction into account here

;; we need the mass of a baseball -- which is about .15 kg.

;; so now we just need to write a procedure that performs a simple integration
;; of these equations -- there are more sophisticated methods but a simple one 
;; is just to step along by some step size in t and add up the values

;; dx = u dt
;; dy = v dt
;; du = - 1/m speed beta u dt
;; dv = - (1/m speed beta v + g) dt

;; initial conditions
;; u_0 = V cos alpha
;; v_0 = V sin alpha
;; y_0 = h
;; x_0 = 0

;; we want to start with these initial conditions, then take a step of size dt
;; (which could be say 0.1) and compute new values for each of these parameters
;; when y reaches the desired point (<= 0) we stop, and return the distance (x)
